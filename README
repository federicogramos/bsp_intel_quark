Overview of Quark Software Release
==================================

Quark Software Release uses a combolayer script to combine
multiple git repos to form a Quark SW distro repo that can
be used for Quark platforms.

The aim of Quark Software Release is to lay down the foundation
for enabling Quark platforms. To align to Intel IoT Devkit initiative,
Quark Software Release has been refactored from older Quark repo folder/path
structure to follow Intel IoT Devkit.

Any developers interested in adopting Intel IoT Devkit repo can
obtain the repo from:
    git://git.yoctoproject.org/meta-intel-iot-devkit

As Quark Software Release lays down the foundation for enabling
Quark platforms, core ingredients such as GRUB, kernel patches & etc
are also synced into the above Intel IoT Devkit repo regularly.

For developers that are interested in expanding the reference Quark distro
for other purposes, it is encouraged that developers familiarize with the
capability of Combo-layer as documented at:

https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Combo-layer

In fact, developers can customize setup/combolayer-quark.conf before setup.sh
script is executed to add in more files, folders or an entire new repo from
OpenEmbedded to form your own.

The current Quark SW repo dependency is as follows:

URI: git://git.yoctoproject.org/poky.git
branch: daisy
revision: refer to setup/combolayer-quark.conf

URI: git://git.yoctoproject.org/meta-intel-iot-devkit
branch: devkit-daisy-1.6.1
revision: refer to setup/combolayer-quark.conf

Installation
============
1) If you are behind corporate network proxy, please make sure your build machine is 
   properly setup with network proxy information, for example:
   a) /etc/environment or ~/.bashrc are exporting the following environment variables:
      - export http_proxy=<proxy server IP|DNS>:<port>
      - export https_proxy=<proxy server IP|DNS>:<port>
      - export ftp_proxy=<proxy server IP|DNS>:<port>
      - export socks_server=<proxy server IP|DNS>:<port>
   b) ~/.gitconfig or GIT_PROXY_COMMAND is setup to point to proxy command for example:
      #!/bin/bash
       exec socat stdio SOCKS:<proxy server's IP|DNS>:$1:$2
  Note: you can skip the above configuration if you are not behind network proxy.

2) Make sure setup.sh is executable
  $ chmod +x setup.sh

3) Execute setup.sh script to automatically create Quark Software distro
  $ ./setup.sh
  Note: by default a git repo is setup after the new repo is created. If you are not
  interested to track your development change, you can simply remove ".git" folder.

To uninstall software
=====================
1) Make sure unsetup.sh script is executable
   $ chmod +x unsetup.sh

2) Execute unsetup.sh script to automatically to revert your workspace to the original
   state after the software package is extracted.
   $ ./unsetup.sh

3) If your intention of unsetup the software is because you want to bring in more ingredients
   through the modified combolayer-quark.conf, please make sure you backup your previously
   committed patches on the git repo through "git format-patch". Then, remove the ".git"
   folder before calling setup.sh to create a new repo again. Finally, reapply your patch changes
   ontop of the newly created repo through "git am".

Building the software
=====================
1) source the repo environment
   $ source iot-devkit-init-build-env build
  Note: the above step will move your "pwd" to be under "build" folder.

2) To build an SD Card image
   $ bitbake image-full
  Note: the output of the build process is located under tmp/deploy/images/quark

3) To build a SPI flash image
   a) modify "build/conf/local.conf" as follow:
      DISTRO ?= "iot-devkit-spi"
      #DISTRO ?= "iot-devkit-multilibc"
   b) build a SPI flash image
      $ bitbake image-spi

Contribute to Yocto Recipe Changes
==================================
Right now layer is not yet hosted on public git repo. In order to contribute:
- make sure you have correct user.name/user.email in git config
- modify desired file
- git add <desired file>
- git commit -s # properly document down the patch changes.

Note: if you are using Intel IoT Devkit repo as your base, please send all of your
patch changes to IoT Devkit Repo maintainer, we also appreciate that the Quark Software
Distro maintainers are CC'ed in the email too.
